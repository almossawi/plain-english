        <h1>Plain English: A Cheat Sheet of Things to Be Wary Of</h1>
        <h2>Oversights and style issues that can lead to ambiguity</h2>


        <h3>1 It’s, its</h3>
        <p>“It’s a good idea to break the module into its functional parts.”</p>

        <h3>2 They’re, their, there</h3>
        <p>“They’re unsure of their direction. It’s neither here nor there.”</p>

        <h3>3 That, of</h3>
        <p>Ask myself if it's needed.</p>
        <p>“We picked the framework <strike>that</strike> we liked most.”</p>
        <p>“Once inside <strike>of</strike> the host, we made our first lateral move through the network.”</p>

        <h3>4 Who, whom, that</h3>
        <p>Use <i>who</i> if the person is the subject, <i>whom</i> if the person is the object, and <i>that</i> if it’s an object or if it’s a group of objects or people.</p>
        <p>“David Tennant, whom I like, and who played Doctor Who at one point, is a charming man.”<sup>*</sup></p>

        <h3>5 Which, that</h3>
        <p><i>Which</i> when the quality is merely descriptive. <i>That</i> when the quality identifies the thing in a set of similar things. A clause starting with <i>which</i> has a comma on either side and removing the clause doesn’t change the sentence’s meaning. Aesthetically, <i>that</i> is less intrusive.</p>
        <p>“The Monaco Editor is the code editor <strike>which</strike> that powers VS Code.”</p>
        <p>“The Monaco Editor, which is loved by thousands of developers, is the code editor that powers VS Code.”</p>

        <h3>6 Many, much</h3>
        <p><i>Many</i> if I can count the thing, <i>much</i> if I can’t.</p>
        <p>“This function is complex—it has too many lines.”</p>
        <p>“This function is complex—there’s too much going on in it.”</p>

        <h3>7 Fewer, less</h3>
        <p><i>Fewer</i> if I can count the thing, <i>less</i> if I can’t.</p>
        <p>“Fewer meetings means less anxiety at the end of the day.”</p>

        <h3>8 Imply, infer</h3>
        <p><i>Imply</i> means something being true is tied to something else being true.</p>
        <p>“The study’s results are shown to two decimal places, which implies the analysis must be precise.”</p>
        <p>“The codebase is modular, which implies it is easy to maintain.”</p>
        <p><i>Infer</i> means an understanding of something gives me reason to make a guess about something else. With an implication, it’s someone else  doing it. With an inference, I’m the one making it.</p>
        <p>“I can infer from our retention numbers that the product isn’t really sticking.”</p>

        <h3>9 Farther, further, faather</h3>
        <p><i>Farther</i> for real concepts. <i>Further</i> for abstract ones. <i>Faather</i> if John F. Kennedy had been cast as Darth Vader.</p>
        <p>“I’m further along with this writeup than I had thought.”</p>
        <p>“I’m farther down the street.”</p>
        <p>“No, I am your faather … Luke.”</p>

        <h3>10 Collective nouns</h3>
        <p>Refer to a set of people using a singular verb, unless you want to emphasize the set’s members.</p>
        <p>“The team is happy with the schedule.”</p>
        <p>“The company is doing well.”</p>
        <p>“Management are deliberating about how to respond to the recent attack on our backbone.”</p>

        <h3>11 Mostly consensus, most, plurality, sizable</h3>
        <p>There’s either a consensus or there isn’t one.</p>
        <p><i>Most</i> suggests more than half.</p>
        <p><i>Plurality</i> means a substantial group, though not necessarily most.</p>
        <p><i>Sizable</i> means a decently-sized group.</p>
        <p>Use the term that most accurately reflects reality.</p>

        <h3>12 Utilize, employ, enumerate</h3>
        <p><i>Use</i> is better than <i>utilize</i>.</p>
        <p><i>Use</i> is better than <i>employ</i>.</p>
        <p><i>List</i> is better than <i>enumerate</i>.</p>

        <h3>13 Uninterested, disinterested</h3>
        <p><i>Uninterested</i> means not interested. <i>Disinterested</i> means impartial and is generally a good thing.</p>
        <p>“The disinterested investor was uninterested in my ‘gut feelings’ about interest rates.”</p>

        <h3>14 Literally, actual</h3>
        <p>Do I mean to say <i>literally</i>—as in, in a literal sense—or do I mean to say <i>figuratively</i>?</p>
        <p>Do I mean to say <i>actual</i>—as in, not abstract—or do I mean to say <i>current</i>?</p>
        <p>“They’ll <strike>literally</strike> lose their minds when they hear the production servers went down on release day.”</p>
        <p>“The experiment’s <strike>actual</strike> current setup is straightforward.”</p>

        <h3>15 Affect, effect</h3>
        <p><i>Affect</i> is a verb. <i>Effect</i> is a noun.</p>
        <p>“To affect an idempotent function’s effects, you have to pass it different arguments.”</p>

        <h3>16 Lay, lie</h3>
        <p>You lie down. You lay something down. Their present and past tenses are a bit strange.</p>
        <p>“Lie down, so I can lay a copy of Les Misérables on your face. Have you lain here before? Have you laid anything on your face before? I lay here once and laid a book on my face. It was glorious.”</p>

        <h3>17 Towards, whilst, amongst</h3>
        <p><i>Toward</i> is more colloquial than <i>towards</i>. Either way, pick one and stick with it.</p>

        <h3>18 So, as we all know, rather, it turns out, right</h3>
        <p>Avoid preambles that presuppose facts about the world without evidence.</p>
        <p>“The goal of life is to be happy, right.”</p>
        <p>“It turns out, the goal of life is to be happy.”</p>
        <p>“As we all know, the goal of life is to be happy.”</p>

        <h3>19 Time of day</h3>
        <p>Suffixes denoting the time of day are a.m. and p.m. or AM and PM. Always with a single space before it.</p>
        <p>8 AM, 8 a.m.<strike>, 8 A.M., 8 am, 8AM</strike></p>

        <h3>20 '90s</h3>
        <p>Apostrophes replace the omitted part of a word.</p>
        <p>“Why are you adding double colons between links? Are you from the <strike>90's</strike> '90s?”</p>

        <h3>21 Nineteenth century</h3>
        <p>The eighteenth century means the 1700s, the nineteenth century means the 1800s, and so on.</p>
        <p>“In several ways, nineteenth-century Cornwall was like today’s Silicon Valley.”</p>

        <h3>22 Em dashes (—) and hyphens (-)</h3>
        <p>“Checking in a file is straightforward—select the file, wait for it to finish uploading, then press the <i>check-in</i> button.”</p>
        <p>No dash for the verb (checking in), an em dash to say what follows explains what was just said, and a hyphen for the compound noun (check-in). Don’t capitalize the first letter after the em dash.</p>
        <p>Not all compound nouns have hyphens. Hyphenated ones that have been in use for a while may lose their hyphens. For instance, <i>email</i> and <i>today</i>. Compound adjectives that precede nouns always have hyphens.</p>
        <p>“There’s no need to check in the checked-in file.”</p>

        <h3>23 Suspended hyphens</h3>
        <p>When the phrases <i>two-week Sprints</i> and <i>three-week Sprints</i> are squished together, they become <i>two- to three-week Sprints.</i></p>
        <p>“The Scrum team will have two- to three-week Sprints, depending on how many demos we have to give.”</p>

        <h3>24 Mixing ‘, ', and `</h3>
        <p>The left single quotation mark (‘), apostrophe ('), and grave accent (`) are different characters. However I choose to use them, be consistent. Slack, Google Docs, and some native editors will automatically change an apostrophe to a left or right quote depending on context.</p>

        <h3>25 Possession</h3>
        <p>A sentence with an apostrophe often reads better than one that doesn’t have one.</p>
        <p>“The metadata of the file.”</p>
        <p>Rewrite as</p>
        <p>“The file’s metadata.”</p>
        <p>No apostrophes for plurals, even if the word is an abbreviation, acronym, or foreign.</p>
        <p>“Each team’s quarterly report ought to have three How-Tos and two demos.”</p>

        <h3>26 Apostrophes for words ending in S</h3>
        <p><i>Scanners’s</i> is usually clearer than <i>Scanners’</i>, especially if the font or formatting make the trailing apostrophe hard to see.</p>

        <h3>27 Superfluous words, imperatives, and annotations</h3>
        <p>“This application supports Node v1.1 and v1.2.”</p>
        <p>Rewrite as</p>
        <p>“This application supports Node 1.1 and 1.2.”</p>
        <p>“To read more, <span class='underline'>click here</span>.”</p>
        <p>Rewrite as</p>
        <p>“<span class='underline'>Read more</span>”</p>
        <p>“<strike>In the past, we’ve, </strike>We’ve always done design reviews early on in the process.”</p>
        <p>“The meeting is at 4 p.m.<strike> in the afternoon.</strike>”</p>

        <h3>28 Stylizing proper nouns</h3>
        <p>GitHub, not Github.</p>
        <p>JavaScript, not Javascript</p>
        <p>Photoshop, not PhotoShop.</p>
        <p>Salesforce, not SalesForce.</p>
        <p>Facebook, not FaceBook.</p>
        <p>Reddit is OK as Reddit, since it’s stylized as “reddit” only in its logo.</p>

        <h3>29 Numbers</h3>
        <p>Unless they’re meant to be compared to one another, part of an equation, or referencing a table or figure, spell out numbers under 10 and those that are at the start of a sentence. Write all other numbers using numerals.</p>

        <h3>30 Units</h3>
        <p>Append units to numbers every time. Precede units with a single space. Capitalize them <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units'>according to the SI guidelines</a>, or <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units'>according to the USCS guidelines</a> if using Freedom units.</p>
        <p>“The page’s time to first paint is 80 ms and its time to first meaningful paint is 600 ms.”</p>
        <!--<p>“As the meeting approached its second hour, he suddenly felt himself fall into an all-consuming silence. The world around him darkened, and a coldness forced itself inside his lungs. He brought up the gravimeter app on his smartwatch. It flashed 8&nbsp;m/s² on the screen, then the reading dropped to 4&nbsp;m/s², then to 2&nbsp;m/s². Then zero. With no sense of shame holding him back, he released the vaporized remains of the gigantic burrito he had downed for lunch. The subsequent cloud of raging air, short though it was, dislodged him from his seat and lifted him up toward the open skylight, to face the world anew.”</p>-->

        <h3>31 Parentheses</h3>
        <p>Parentheses break a line’s flow. Can I rewrite the sentence so I don’t have to use them?</p>
        <p>“We’ve put together a simple (proof-of-concept right now) app for rendering arbitrary animations.”</p>
        <p>Rewrite as</p>
        <p>“We’ve put together a proof-of-concept for rendering arbitrary animations.”</p>

        <h3>32 Them, he or she, him or her</h3>
        <p>Pronouns are less personal and can lead to ambiguity. Avoid <i>them</i> as a replacement for <i>him or her</i> and <i>they</i> as a replacement for <i>he or she</i>. It breaks a sentence’s subject-verb agreement. Avoid <i>him or her</i> if possible.</p>
        <p>“The user journey begins with a user clicking the <i>Start</i> button. <strike>He or she</strike> The user may then choose between a <i>Simple</i> and a <i>Custom</i> flow. If <strike>they</strike> the user <strike>choose</strike> chooses <i>Simple</i>, the whole process ought to take no more than twenty seconds.”</p>

        <h3>33 Colons</h3>
        <p>A colon says that what follows is a list of things. Don’t capitalize the first letter after the colon.</p>
        <p>“During the postmortem session, we’ll cover three things: things that went well, things we can learn from, and things we think we could have done differently.”</p>
        <p>“During the postmortem session, we’ll cover things that went well, things we can learn from, and things we think we could have done differently.”</p>

        <h3>34 Forward slashes</h3>
        <p>Separate items in a list with commas, not forward slashes. With commas, the conjunction or disjunction is explicit—and, or—whereas with a forward slash it’s often an implicit disjunction, or occasionally, an implicit ‘these two things are interchangeable.’</p>
        <p>“<strike>Buttons/menus/data graphics</strike> Buttons, menus, and data graphics constitute UI components.”</p>

        <h3>35 Comma at the end of a series</h3>
        <p>A comma before the final conjunction or disjunction in a series, while not required, can reduce ambiguity.</p>
        <p>“Good code is consistent, understandable, and maintainable.”</p>

        <h3>36 Active voice</h3>
        <p>The active voice is more personal than the passive voice.</p>
        <p>“The command should be run.”</p>
        <p>Rewrite as</p>
        <p>“Run the command.”</p>

        <h3>37 Bullet points</h3>
        <p>Full sentences, ideally. A period at the end of each line, unless the line is a fragment.</p>

        <h3>38 Could care less</h3>
        <p>The correct phrase is <i>Couldn’t care less</i>.</p>
        <p>“I couldn’t care less what the critics think. I know the team did a phenomenal job.”</p>

        <h3>39 Define acronyms</h3>
        <p>Define an acronym the first time I use it, unless it’s undeniably ubiquitous among all my readers.</p>
        <p>“Multi-factor authentication (MFA) continues to trend up across the industry. Table 1 shows MFA numbers from the past year.”</p>

        <h3>40 Capitalize acronyms</h3>
        <p>JSON, not json.</p>
        <p>OK, not ok.</p>

        <h3>41 Title capitalization</h3>
        <p>Capitalize the first word in an email subject or section heading and don’t worry about the rest. That’s easier to remember than which style manual allows me to capitalize which words.</p>

        <h3>42 Abbreviations</h3>
        <p>Avoid if possible. Spell things out.</p>

        <h3>43 Starting emails</h3>
        <p>Add a comma after the greeting. As far as I can tell, only publishing people care about this one.</p>
        <p>“Hi, Fred.”</p>
        <p>“Fred, hi.”</p>

        <h3>44 Ending emails</h3>
        <p>I’d avoid <i>Best</i>—the email equivalent of a Facebook <i>happy birthday</i>.</p>

        <h3>45 Etc</h3>
        <p>Often not needed and only serves to make an idea imprecise. If the series really is infinite, maybe replace it with <i>and so on</i>.</p>
        <p>“Analyzing complexity means looking at lines-of-code, files, code paths, etc.”</p>
        <p>Better to say</p>
        <p>“Analyzing complexity means looking at lines-of-code, files, code paths, and dependencies.”</p>

        <h3>46 Et al</h3>
        <p>Outside of academia, using <i>et al</i> is a bit strange. Maybe replace it with <i>and colleagues</i>, <i>and company</i>, or <i>and team</i>.</p>

        <h3>47 E.g. and i.e.</h3>
        <p>They’re awkward and not universally understood in the same way. Maybe replace them with English words.</p>
        <p><i>For instance,</i> instead of <i>e.g.</i></p>
        <p><i>Put differently,</i> instead of <i>i.e.</i></p>

        <h3>48 Ellipses</h3>
        <p>Ellipses replace the missing part of a line or series with three dots, each optionally separated from the other with a space, and the first dot preceded by a space. Don’t append it to <i>etc</i>. Don’t capitalize the first letter after the ellipses. To avoid ellipses possibly breaking when a line wraps, use the <i>ellipses</i> character instead of typing three dots.</p>
        <p>The focus group’s top comment was, “The modal doesn’t work well on mobile … and is finicky on desktop.”</p>
        <p>“1, 9, 15, 21, …, 29”</p>

        <h3>49 Citations</h3>
        <p>Square brackets reference other content or external material. They’re not read as part of the sentence. They exist, but aren’t acknowledged.</p>
        <p>“Code quality is closely associated with coupling and cohesion [1].”</p>
        <p>And not</p>
        <p>“[1] shows that code quality is closely associated with coupling and cohesion.”</p>

        <h3>50 Double negatives</h3>
        <p>I love double negatives. Even so, I try to avoid them. In writing as well as in coding.</p>
        <p>“If we don’t address the ambiguity, we’ll find ourselves<strike>, not impossibly,</strike> heading down a difficult path.”</p>
        <p>“This prototype is <strike>not dissimilar</strike> similar to the old prototype.”</p>

        <h3>51 Jack and I</h3>
        <p>Generally, use <i>I</i> if I’m the subject and <i>me</i> if I’m the object.</p>
        <p>“Jack and I ate a pie.”</p>
        <p>“The talking pie ate Jack and me.”</p>
        <p>If I take out <i><b>Jack and</b></i> does the sentence still sound right?</p>

        <h3>52 Worst, worse</h3>
        <p><i>Worst</i> is what someone who likes using superlatives might say. <i>Worse</i> means something is not better than something else.</p>
        <p>“We have the worst roads, folks. The worst roads.”</p>
        <p>“This morning’s poker game was the worst. It was worse than the time I lost our Q1 budget to Jenny in Software Engineering.”</p>

        <h3>53 Due to</h3>
        <p>The sentence has to make sense when I replace <i>due to</i> with some form of <i>caused&nbsp;by</i>.</p>
        <p>“My insomnia is due to all the traveling I’ve been doing.”</p>
        <p>“I worked from home <strike>due to</strike> because of traffic.”</p>

        <h3>54 Very, just</h3>
        <p>Ask myself if adverbs like <i>very</i> and <i>just</i> add any value to a sentence.</p>
        <p>“Now that we’re caching queries, the app is <strike>very</strike> fast.”</p>
        <p>“I'm <strike>very happy</strike> thrilled with how the product video turned out.”</p>
        <p>“I'm <strike>very sad</strike> devastated we couldn't get more headcount for the upcoming fiscal year.”</p>
        <p>“I'm <strike>just</strike> reaching out to confirm our meeting this afternoon.”</p>

        <h3>55 Split infinitives</h3>
        <p>An infinitive is the word <i>to</i> followed by a verb. It’s an atomic action, thought, or emotion. Splitting an infinitive is adding an adverb in between those two things.</p>
        <p>“To boldly go where no man has gone before.”</p>
        <p>Rewrite as</p>
        <p>“To go, boldly, where no man has gone before.”</p>

        <h3>56 Ironically</h3>
        <p>Avoid using <i>ironically</i> to mean <i>coincidentally</i>.</p>
        <p>“<strike>Ironically,</strike> Coincidentally, I like watching the pre-election debates too.”</p>
        <p>“Ironically, The BBC won’t air <i>Would I Lie to You</i> in December because of the pre-election debates.”<sup>†</sup></p>

        <h3>57 Principal, principle</h3>
        <p><i>Principal</i> is the most important thing in a set of things. <i>Principle</i> is a fundamental truth</i>.</p>
        <p>“Our principal design guideline is ‘Don't try to be clever.’”</p>
        <p>“Our human interface guidelines are informed by the principles of usability and consistency.”</p>
